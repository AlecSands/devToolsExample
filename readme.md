1) I opened the index.html file in my chrome browser.
2) I right clicked the screen and selected inspect.
3) I opened the console tab.
4) I clicked on the error which highlighted the offending piece of code in the javascript
5) I noticed that the called function name was missing an 's'.
6) I added the 's' and refreshed the website and no more errors showed up.
